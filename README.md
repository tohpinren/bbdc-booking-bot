# BBDC Booking Bot
Booking bot that automates looking for cancelled slots and booking if any is found before a threshold date.

I built this bot to speed up my driving license acquisition process. Due to the covid situation and high demand, the waiting time for driving simulator slots at Bukit Batok Driving Centre (BBDC) is an average of 2 months. This bot allowed me to cut the time to 2 weeks.

Bot is made to run headless (ie chrome window does not open) so that it can be run in the background. Bot can be edited to book slots for BTT/FTT/practical lessons and the time range can be changed.

## Built with
- Python
- Selenium
